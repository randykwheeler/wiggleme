## 🚀 Wiggle Me! - Human-Kinematic Engine Ultra

**Wiggle Me!** is not just another mouse wiggler. It is a high-fidelity **human-kinematic simulator** designed to be indistinguishable from a real person's hand movement.

### 🧠 The "WindMouse" Physics Engine

Our latest version is powered by the **Human-Kinematic Engine Ultra**, which uses the sophisticated **WindMouse** algorithm. Unlike robotic "back and forth" wiggle apps, Wiggle Me! treats the cursor as a physical object influenced by:

- **Gravitational Pull**: Smoothly accelerating toward its destination.
- **Random Wind Forces**: Real-time turbulent fluctuations that create authentic micro-shakes and natural curves.
- **Organic Inertia**: Perfectly modeled momentum that mirrors the biological movement of human muscles.
