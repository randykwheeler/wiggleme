## 💎 Why Wiggle Me?

Unlike traditional "mouse wigglers" that move the cursor in robotic, linear paths, **Wiggle Me!** is built on a custom **Human-Kinematic Engine**.

### 🧬 The Human Movement Difference

Most wiggling software is easily detected by modern analytics because it relies on predictable patterns (circles, squares, or simple jitter). **Wiggle Me!** utilizes **Cubic Bezier Curves** to generate fluid, randomized mouse paths that mimic the actual biological tremor and arced movement of a human arm.

- **Non-Linear Interpolation**: No straight lines. Every movement follows a natural arc.
- **Randomized Micro-Variations**: Sub-pixel micro-jittering simulates the natural instability of a human hand.
- **Dynamic Velocity**: The cursor accelerates and decelerates naturally, avoiding the constant-speed signature of bots.

## 🌟 Premium Features

### 🌪️ Chaos Mode

Need to simulate intense activity? **Chaos Mode** throws the cursor into a high-energy, randomized flight pattern across your entire screen workspace.

### 🛡️ Intelligent Manual Override

We value your time. The moment you move your physical mouse, **Wiggle Me!** detects the manual interference and **instantly terminates** all automated movement. You never have to "fight" for control.

### ⚡ Lightning Fast & Lightweight

Built with pure C++ and the native Win32 API, **Wiggle Me!** consumes near-zero system resources. No .NET dependencies, no Electron bloat—just performance.

---

## 🎨 Professional Interface

- **System-Native UI**: Matches your Windows theme for a seamless experience.
- **Animated Mascot**: A reactive, wiggling character that provides instant visual feedback.
