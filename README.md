## 💎 Why Wiggle Me?

Unlike traditional mouse wigglers that move the cursor in robotic, linear paths, **Wiggle Me!** is built on a custom **Human-Kinematic Engine**.

### 🧬 The Human Movement Difference

Most wiggling software is easily detected by modern analytics because it relies on predictable patterns. **Wiggle Me!** utilizes **Cubic Bezier Curves** to generate fluid, randomized mouse paths that mimic the actual biological tremor and arced movement of a human arm.

- **Non-Linear Interpolation**: Every movement follows a natural arc, just like a real hand.
- **Randomized Micro-Variations**: Sub-pixel micro-jittering simulates the natural instability of human touch.
- **Dynamic Velocity**: The cursor accelerates and decelerates naturally, avoiding the constant-speed signature of bots.

## 🌟 Premium Features

### 🌪️ Chaos Mode

Need to simulate intense activity? **Chaos Mode** throws the cursor into a high-energy, randomized flight pattern across your entire screen.

### 🛡️ Intelligent Manual Override

The moment you move your physical mouse, **Wiggle Me!** detects it and **instantly stops**. You never have to "fight" the app for control.

### ⚡ Lightning Fast & Lightweight

Built with pure C++ and the native Win32 API for zero overhead. No dependencies, no bloat—just pure speed.
